                <h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
                <p>
                  In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level
                  job at a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still
                  in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oak mont. Together
                  with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers,
                  Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of
                  millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a
                  hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close
                  in on his empire of excess.

                <h3>Iron Man 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Plagued with worry and insomnia since saving New York from destruction,
                  Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), now, is more dependent on the suits that
                  give him his Iron Man persona -- so much so that every aspect of his life
                  is affected, including his relationship with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow).
                  After a malevolent enemy known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) reduces
                  his personal world to rubble, Tony must rely solely on instinct and
                  ingenuity to avenge his losses and protect the people he loves.

                <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
                <p>
                    Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself
                  as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field),
                  he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the
                  gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining
                  a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism.
                  But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to
                  save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin
                  Wright).
